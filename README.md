#### 1. Perceptrons
- [ ] demo project
- [ ] note
- [ ] doing exercise
  ##### 2.b. Note
0. What is a **Perceptrons**:

* A type of Artificial neuron
* Developed in 50s and 60s by Frank Rosenblatt

1. How it work?
 

#### 2. Sigmoid neurons
- [ ] demo project
- [ ] note
- [ ] doing exercise
  ##### 2.c. Exercise
1. Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part I  
**Suppose we take all the weights and biases in a network of perceptrons, and multiply them by a positive constant, c>0. Show that the behaviour of the network doesn't change.**
```
ANSWER:

- According to the concept, the output value of a NoP is:
  * 0 if Sum of (wj)(xj) <= *threshold*
  * 1 if Sum of (wj)(xj) > *threshold*

  Therefore if before value is 0, new value is still 0*c = 0 and the same with 1
```
